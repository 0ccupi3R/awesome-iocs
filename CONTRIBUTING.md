The goal of this project is to identify various sources indicators of compromise and bring them together to help people get started with detecting known threats. This should focus on indicators and less on tools (though a few IOC specific tools have been added).

If you're interested in adding to the Awesome IOCs list feel free to submit your pull request using the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
